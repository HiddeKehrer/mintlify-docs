# í•‘ The pyjama ecosystem

The mcpyjama ecosystem stands for the democratization of AI agent tool stack. It consists of several components:

*   **Pyjama studio:** a no-code tool deployment platform that allows you to power your agent to advanced tools, using nothing more that one-single URL (a pyjama).

*   **Pyjama marketplace:** submit your own MCP server to expose the community to your services. Monetise your agents utility by giving everyone access to your services.

*   **Pyjama dashboard:** a centralised hub to control all your integrations, with a single click of the switch.
