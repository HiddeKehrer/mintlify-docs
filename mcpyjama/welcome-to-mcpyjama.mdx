> A Universal Bridge Between AI Agents and Real-World Tools


Connecting AI agents to real-world tools and data is still harder than it should be. Teams face complex, custom integrations that slow them down. Giving agents the ability to act should be democratized and easily accessible to all.


We built mcpyjama because we believe the next evolution of AI won't just be in smarter models, it will be focussed on giving every agent seamless access to the tools it needs to take action.

Powered by the open Model Context Protocol (MCP), mcpyjama makes tool integration effortless. Mcpyjama lets agents "wear" a pyjama: a unified integration layer that connects them to an ever-growing wardrobe of MCP servers and tools. Our hosted solution lets anyone connect business tools, APIs, and data sources to their AI agents without infrastructure headaches. No custom infrastructure. Just real-time capability, when and where you need it.

With our plug-and-play platform, developers, teams, and autonomous agents can unlock context-rich, AI-powered capabilities across their stack in seconds.

If you're a startup or tool provider, mcpyjama gives you a powerful new distribution channel. By hosting your MCP server on our marketplace, you make your product instantly discoverable and testable by the entire ecosystem, turning visibility into adoption.
