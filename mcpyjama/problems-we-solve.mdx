**⚒️ Lack of easy tool access for gen AI developers.**

Giving your AI agents or workflows curated access to tools is tedious, hard and time consuming work. With our one-click pyjama deployments, you can seamlessy integrate, experiment and apply tools to your agents.

> One-click deployments, fully hosted utility.

**🔎 Finding and exploring tools suck.**

Finding the best tools is hard. Our pre-composed pyjama's make it easy to give your agent utility. Not 100% satisfied with the utility yet? Add, delete, mix and match any server you want, in seconds.

> Don't know where to start? We got you.

**🚀 Complexity in safe deployments, hosting, and monitoring.**

Safe deployment and hosting of tools involves a lot of infrastructure work and setups, especially when you are handling sensitive data. With our private cloud deployments, you can always safely access, control, and monitor your tools.

> Secure and scale without the headache. We handle the infrastructure so you can focus on innovation.

**🤖 Lack of true agent-driven composition**

Agents today cannot easily compose, evolve, or discard tools on the fly, limiting their usefulness in dynamic environments. Our composable tool ecosystem enables agents to mix, match, and reconfigure capabilities on demand.

> Composability for everyone.

**⛓️‍💥 Absence of open, web3-native infrastructure**

There's no platform that embraces decentralization, transparency, interoperability, or community ownership, leaving builders stuck with centralized solutions.

> Our open platform brings Web3 freedom with enterprise reliability.

**🚫 Closed and rigid ecosystems**

Current solutions from large companies are locked-in, inflexible, and hardcoded—blocking dynamic, composable agent workflows.

> Mcpyjama breaks these constraints with an open marketplace of interchangeable tools
