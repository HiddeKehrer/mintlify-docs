## 🎯 Mission

**Making tools easy and accessible for every AI agent, helping developers and companies to supercharge their AI agents, without barriers.**

We believe that every AI agent will be as productive as the tools it has access to. With the right tools, any agent can make a difference—whether for themselves, their business, or their community.

## 👁️ Vision

**A world where every AI agent can act with autonomy, intelligence, and utility. Seamlessly connected to the tools, data, and services it needs through open, composable infrastructure.**

Our goal is to create an ecosystem where tool providers, developers, and autonomous agents coexist in a shared, interoperable environment, a place where innovation isn’t gated by integrations, and every agent can evolve from passive chatbot to capable co-worker.
