## 🎯 Mission

Making tools easy and accessible for every AI agent, helping developers and companies to supercharge their AI agents, without barriers.

We believe that every AI agent will be as productive as the tools it has access to. With the right tools, any agent can make a difference—whether for themselves, their business, or their community.

## 👁️ Vision

Democratizing real-world capabilities for agents

At mcpyjama, we believe that every agent should have the freedom to act, not just think. Our mission is to remove the friction in how AI agents access real-world tools by offering an open, hosted layer of MCP servers. Until now, agents have been trapped in closed ecosystems, dependent on hardcoded integrations, or forced to build custom infrastructure. Mcpyjama changes that.

> We provide plug-and-play MCP server hosting, allowing developers, companies, and AI agents to tap into an ever-expanding library of curated, composable, production-ready tools.
